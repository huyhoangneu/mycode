Please, if you are going to submit any patches, use the linux kernel coding
style (for those which are not familiar with it, it's basically just k&r).

If you haven't, read it from linux/Documentation/CodingStyle; it's an
excellent doc and everything applies here.

Yeah i'm aware that this is python and not C, but the style idea is the same
except a few minor things.

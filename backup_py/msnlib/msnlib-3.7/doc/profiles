The msn client, from release D5, supports different profiles.

What this means is that now you can have several configurations under the same
unix user in a very simple way.

Just create a profile like you normally create your configuration, telling the
setup the profile name, like:

msnsetup profilename


Then, to run msn under an specific profile, do:

msn profilename

and you're done.

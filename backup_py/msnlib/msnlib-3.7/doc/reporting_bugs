How to report bugs
------------------

If you think you've got a bug (or you are sure about it =), please report it
to albertito@blitiri.com.ar; specifying:

* msnlib version
* python version
* operating system information
* platform information
* obviously, a bug description

Now, depending on what's the bug about, i'd like you to to include some of
these:

* a copy of the output when the bug hits (see below for a complete to do this)
* reports on other versions (does this happens with an older version?)
* instructions on how to reproduce it
* terminal information (ie. running under normal console, some kind of xterm,
	cygwin terminal, beos one, etc.)
* an strace -tt of the session
* the debug output

On these last two, they're oftenly quite useful. Just in case you don't know
how to do it, a nice way of doing both at the same time and save to files
(which then you can send to me as attachments) is:

* first, add 'debug = yes' to $HOME/.msn/msnrc; that enables debugging output
* then, run the command:
	strace -tt -o msn_output-strace msn 2>msn_output-debug | tee msn_output-stdout
	
and try to reproduce the bug, or just wait for it to happen =)

Then, when reporting, send me these 3 files (msn_output-strace,
msn_output-debug, and msn_output-stdout), compressed if necesary. They are
really helpful, because I can see what's going on when the bug happened.

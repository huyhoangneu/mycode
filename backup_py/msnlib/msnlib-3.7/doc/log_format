This document describes the msn client log format.

The files are named only with the email address of the sender/receiver; except
for the multi-user chats (that is, a chat with more than you and somebody else
involved) where the name is composed of 'M::' and then the list of
participants (excluding yourself) sorted in alphabetical order, separated by
commas (',').


The format is very simple:

Day/Month/Year HH:MM:SS email ID text

where ID is one of:
	'>>>' if the text is an outgoing message
	'<<<' if the text is an incoming message
	'***' if the text refers to a new status
	'+++' if the text refers to multi-user chats (joining and leaving)

and email is the email of the user you send the message to/got a message from,
except on the multi-user chat case, where for messages you sent your own
email address is displayed.


For example:
Day/Month/Year HH:MM:SS email *** online
Day/Month/Year HH:MM:SS email <<< incoming message
Day/Month/Year HH:MM:SS email >>> outgoing message
Day/Month/Year HH:MM:SS email *** offline
Day/Month/Year HH:MM:SS email +++ join


For multi-line messages, the message is indented with a tab, like:
Day/Month/Year HH:MM:SS email <<<
	line1
	line2
	...
	linen


In the utils directory you can find the file "msnlog.vim", which is a vim
syntax highlighting file for this log format.

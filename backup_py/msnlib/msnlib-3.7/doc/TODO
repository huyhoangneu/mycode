package TODO
* more documentation (client manpages, basic api, etc.)
* allow installer to detect python location
	it is a possibility to have special installers for non-unix platforms

msn client TODO
* be able to use nick with spaces
	this can cause a lot of damage, is it worthy?
* line editing
* make tab completion work with any command besides 'm'
* handle SIGWINCH for terminal resizes if signals are available
* colours for the user list


Future / In doubt
-----------------
(things listed here are either marked to do in some future (because we have to
wait on some feature becoming popular) or are in doubt of ever being
implemented at all)

msn client
* signal handling
	when the signal module becames popular on distros, we can get rid of
	the select() ugly stuff for auto-away and re-implement it using
	alarm() or things like that; add support for SIGWINCH, send syncs
	often, etc.


msn lib 
* file transfer
	this is waaaaay below in my priority lists. there are thousand of
	better ways to do file transfer between two hosts; plus the protocol
	is even more ugly than the messaging one (yes, it really is)
* micq integration
	in a perfect world, this wouldn't even exist and we would have micq
	talk the msn protocol. so the ideal solution would be to rewrite all
	this in C and integrate it with micq; probably working in two
	different levels: one would be the C implementation of this, and the
	other one micq multiprotocol support, that allows a clean integration
	with it

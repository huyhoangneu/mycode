To install the library and the client, run the 'install' file as root
(probably using something like './install').

It will copy the python modules to the proper place, and the client to
/usr/local/bin.

Then, you can run (as your user) 'msnsetup' to create the initial
configuration file and directories (placed in ~/.msn); and finally run the
client with 'msn'. Skip this step if you are upgrading.

Alternatively, you can create your own ~/.msn/msnrc file based on an example
named 'msnrc.sample'.


Here is a command line summary:

# we became root
su

# then install everything
./install

# now drop the root privileges
exit

# run the setup to create the configuration (only if you are not upgrading)
msnsetup

# and finally start the client
msn
